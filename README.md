### SkateSpots
Skate Spots is a skate spot search site for the skateboard community. Users upload either their own personal favorite spots or known spots. Users also have the ability to comment/ rate other spots.

## Motivation
This project was created to fufill a need for new skateboarders. New could be defined as either just starting out or new to a specific location. Often times when a skateboarder moves to a new location he/she is unaware of where to go skateboard. This site allows for that skateboarder to tap into a once before hidden community by visiting 'new' spots. Not only does this site serve as a spot locator but also as an introduction to a new skate community.
